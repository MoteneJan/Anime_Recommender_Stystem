# ANIME RECOMMENDER SYSTEM STREAMLIT

#### 1 Running the Streamlit web app on your local machine

As a first step to becoming familiar with our web app's functioning, we recommend setting up a running instance on your own local machine. To do this, follow the steps below by running the given commands within a Git bash (Windows), or terminal (Mac/Linux):

- Ensure that you have the prerequisite Python libraries installed on your local machine:

 ```bash
 pip install -U streamlit numpy pandas scikit-learn
 ```

- Navigate to the base of your repo where your base_app.py is stored, and start the Streamlit app.

 ```bash
 cd /Streamlit/
 streamlit run base_app.py
 ```

 If the web server was able to initialise successfully, the following message should be displayed within your bash/terminal session:

```
  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

    Local URL: http://localhost:8501
    Network URL: http://192.168.43.41:8501
```
You should also be automatically directed to the base page of your web app. This should look something like:

</div>
